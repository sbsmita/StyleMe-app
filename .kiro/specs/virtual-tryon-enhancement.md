# Virtual Try-On Enhancement Spec

## Overview
Enhance the virtual try-on feature with improved error handling, real-time status updates, and better user experience following the established development standards.

## Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all API failure scenarios
- Add retry logic for network failures with exponential backoff
- Provide user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors
- Log detailed error information in development mode only

### 2. Real-Time Status Updates
- Show live progress during AI processing
- Display estimated completion time
- Provide cancel functionality for long-running jobs
- Update UI dynamically as job status changes

### 3. Image Quality Validation
- Validate image formats (JPEG, PNG) before processing
- Check image dimensions and file size limits
- Provide guidance for optimal photo quality
- Implement automatic image optimization when needed

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Implement result caching to reduce API calls
- Add request queuing to prevent rate limiting
- Optimize image compression before API submission
- Track and display usage statistics to users

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Error Handling Enhancement
- [ ] Add comprehensive try-catch blocks in all API functions
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create user-friendly error message mapping
- [ ] Add development-only detailed logging

### Phase 2: Real-Time Updates
- [ ] Implement WebSocket or polling for job status updates
- [ ] Add progress indicators with estimated time
- [ ] Create cancel job functionality
- [ ] Update UI components for real-time feedback

### Phase 3: Image Quality & Validation
- [ ] Add image format and size validation
- [ ] Implement automatic image optimization
- [ ] Create photo quality guidance UI
- [ ] Add image preview with quality indicators

### Phase 4: Performance & Caching
- [ ] Implement result caching with TTL
- [ ] Add request queue management
- [ ] Optimize image compression algorithms
- [ ] Create usage tracking dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria

### Error Handling
- All API failures are caught and handled gracefully
- Users see helpful error messages, not technical details
- Failed requests are automatically retried up to 3 times
- All errors are logged in development mode

### Real-Time Updates
- Users see live progress during processing
- Estimated completion time is displayed and updated
- Users can cancel long-running jobs
- UI updates smoothly without flickering

### Image Quality
- Invalid image formats are rejected with clear messages
- Images are automatically optimized for best results
- Users receive guidance on photo quality
- Large images are compressed before processing

### Performance
- Successful results are cached for 24 hours
- API rate limits are never exceeded
- Image processing is optimized for speed
- Users can track their usage and limits

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test all error handling scenarios
- Mock API responses for different failure modes
- Validate image processing functions
- Test caching mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- Test complete virtual try-on flow with real API
- Validate retry logic with network failures
- Test job cancellation functionality
- Verify cache behavior across sessions

### User Acceptance Tests
- Test with various image qualities and formats
- Validate error messages are user-friendly
- Test real-time updates during processing
- Verify performance under load

## Success Metrics
- Error rate reduced by 80%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Average processing time < 10 seconds
- API cost reduced by 30% through caching
