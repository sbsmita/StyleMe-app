/**
 * Placeholder for a virtual try-on AI service.
 * In a real application, this function would make a network request to a VTON (Virtual Try-On) API.
 * These APIs are often complex and may require payment. They would take the user and garment images
 * and return a new image with the garment superimposed on the user.
 *
 * For this demo, we will simulate a network delay and return the user's image as the result.
 *
 * @param {object} userImage - The image asset of the user.
 * @param {object} garmentImage - The image asset of the clothing item.
 * @returns {Promise<object>} A promise that resolves to the resulting image asset.
